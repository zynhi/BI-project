# Business Intelligence System for E-commerce

This project was developed as a capstone assignment for the Data Science program at UEH. It demonstrates a comprehensive BI solution using **Python** and **Power BI** on an e-commerce dataset. The system integrates data processing, customer segmentation, product recommendation, and dashboard visualization to support business decision-making.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Build insightful dashboards for sales, product, and customer analysis using Power BI.
- Apply RFM analysis and K-Means clustering to segment customers based on behavior.
- Develop a hybrid product recommendation system combining collaborative filtering and content-based approaches.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI**: Dashboard design, DAX measures, Power Query for data transformation.
- **Python**: Data preprocessing, clustering (K-Means), recommendation system (Hybrid: CF + CB).
- **Dataset**: [Looker E-Commerce BigQuery Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mustafakeser4/looker-ecommerce-bigquery-dataset)

## ðŸ“Š Dashboards Built

- **Sales Analysis**: Tracks revenue, order volume, average order value, and traffic source performance.
- **Product Analysis**: Shows units sold, revenue by brand, return rates, and Pareto product contribution.
- **Customer Analysis**: Explores customer behavior by age, gender, country, and order patterns over time.

Each dashboard supports slicers by year (2019â€“2024) and includes KPIs such as Total Revenue, Orders, and Profit Margin.
